    <h1>QuickCalories Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: December 11, 2025</strong></p>
    
    <p>Thank you for using QuickCalories ("the App"), developed by Tiago Pereira. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the App. By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera Data:</strong> The App accesses your device's camera to scan food items. Photos are processed locally or via third-party AI services (e.g., Google Gemini API) and are not stored on our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We DO NOT collect usage statistics, such as scan frequency and app interactions, to improve the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Ad-Related Data:</strong> If you watch ads via Google AdMob to earn credits, AdMob may collect data as per their privacy policy (linked below).</li>
        <li><strong>No Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect names, emails, or other personally identifiable information unless you contact us via the support page.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. Sharing Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties, except:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With AI providers (e.g., Google Gemini) for scan processing—data is anonymized and not retained.</li>
        <li>With AdMob for ad delivery—see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        <li>As required by law or to protect our rights.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable measures to protect your data, but no method is 100% secure. Use the App at your own risk.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>
